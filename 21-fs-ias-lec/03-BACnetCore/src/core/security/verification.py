class Verification:
    """
    This class is used by the storage Controller to determine which feeds should be imported or exported.
    Thus, this class, especially the methods should_import() and should_export(), define the export/import rules.

    This class also has a method to validate an event on import -> check signature, hash, in-order.
    Since every imported event is verified, this does not have to be done on export.

    Feed Import rules:
    -------------
    - MASTER feeds are always imported
    - Trusted & not blocked feeds are imported
    - Feeds must be in defined radius(trust radius) Radius == 1 -> are your own feeds

    Feed Export rules:
    -------------
    - Own Master is always exported/proposed
    - trusted feeds that are not bocked are exported (NOTE: Master feeds from other Nodes can also be blocked!)
    
    Radius rules(defined by _check_in_radius()):
    ---------------------------------------------
     - Feed is in radius if it is trusted by a master you know in your social radius
     - One could for example add the rule that just non-blocked feeds are in radius
