Easily download articles from SRF and share them with other users via LAN, Bluetooth or BAC-net.

The easiest way to use the application is by using poetry (https://python-poetry.org/).
Once installed, run "poetry install" in the root directory of the project. 
Now the program can easily be run by executing "poetry run python app/runner.py".
Of course, it is also possible to install all the dependencies using pip.
