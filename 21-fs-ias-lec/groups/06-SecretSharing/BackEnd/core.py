::Export Module::
The core script contains all functions interfacing with the BACNetCore but not directly with other SecretSharing
related scripts. Other groups can import SecretSharing.BackEnd.core to make use of the functionality without getting
complications. core.py will be imported into actions.py and the UI can therefore interface with all functions
here as well. For example private messages should be implemented here.
