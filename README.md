# Project BACnet (BAsel Citizen Net)

The Internet has become so ubiquitous that we take it for granted,
forgetting how much it depends on political goodwill:
Access restrictions are quite common worldwide, be it the “Chinese
firewall”, India cutting the Internet for Kashmir, or the Spanish
Police seizing the DNS name of the Catalan independence movement.

Our goal is to implement communication means that avoid this
dependency, yet support for example social media.

## Spring 2020

In spring 2020, BSc students of the lecture _Introduction to Internet
and Security_ at the [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/)
built a first BACnet system from scratch.

Their source code is collected in this GitHub repository. A final
[113 page report (11MB)](BACnet-Report-2020.pdf) was compiled
from all project reports.


## Fall 2020

The seminar "Internet Re-Decentralization" aims at extending the
first version of BACnet.

## Spring 2021

The next year of BSc students of the lecture _Introduction to Internet
and Security_ at the [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/)
continue Building on BACNet
